# Card Game

Established simple card game: War. Used node for this project. Began by creating a deck that could be used in the game.js file. Created the game using the index of the cards to account for J, Q, K and A being higher than numbers in the array. Returned results of the game in the game.js file then used module.exports to require that file in the main.js file, which ultimately gave the final results.
